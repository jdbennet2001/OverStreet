            "description": "<p><em>Flash tangles with a speedy samurai.</em></p><p>Daisho, a master swordsman, defeats a horde of Samuroids. At Baron Katana's command, Daisho hurls the one Samuroid corpse into the sea. Police forensic scientist, Barry Allen, and his wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West, arrive in Tokyo. Allen and West are greeted by Captain Hashi, a colleague of Allen's. Two men commandeer a fighter jet, on the airfield, and fire it's rockets at Allen, West , and Hashi. Allen, as the Flash, intercepts the rockets, moving so fast as to be invisible to the naked eye. The Flash neutralizes the invisible aura that protects him from the heat of friction, causing him to burst into flames.</p><p>The heat seeking rockets change course, locking on to the Flash's greater heat signature. The Flash leads the rockets back to the fighter jet, which is destroyed on impact. The Flash, as Allen, returns to West and Hashi, with neither even aware that he ever left their side. While Allen confers with Hashi about Baron Katana, Hashi's assistant, Tushi, shows West around the crime laboratory. Daisho raises concerns about shrimpers trolling the waters near Baron Katana's family stronghold, the Black Heron. The shrimpers haul up the dead Samuroid in their nets. Hashi is informed of the discovery.</p><p>West pulls Allen away from the investigation, insisting on a night on the town. After attending a sumo wrestling match, Allen takes West to meet his old college friend, Hideki Toshiro. Now a famed director in Japan, Toshiro is working on his latest Samurai picture. Toshiro is interested in doing some location shooting at the Black Heron, but has been unable to garner permission from the property's owner. A small police outpost, in Hokkaido, is attacked by a flying horde of Samuroids. The compliment of officers stationed there are slaughtered. Hashi is informed of the attack, believing it to be connected to the dead Samuroid found by the shrimpers.</p><p>Allen, West and Toshiro rendezvous back with Hashi. A cursory examination of the Samuroid reveals that it is not human at all, but rather a humanoid machine. It's armor is also completely impervious to gunfire. Toshiro points out the crest of the Black Heron on the armor, linking the Samuroid to the House of Kayido, and Baron Katana. Having heard enough, Allen decides to investigate on his own, as the Flash. Racing up the coastline, the Flash quickly reaches the Black Heron. His approach is picked up by Daisho. Determining the Flash's point of entry into his fortress, Baron Katana prepares a warm welcome for the Scarlet Speedster.</p><p>As the Flash prowls through the corridors of the Black Heron, he suddenly finds himself surrounded by a horde of Samuroids. Barely escaping the horde, the Flash finds himself confronted by Daisho. The two men engage in a fierce battle. Ultimately, Daisho is revealed to be a Samuroid himself, meaning he is all but impervious to harm. Baron Katana reveals himself to the Flash, as Daisho closes in for the kill. Hashi learns that Baron Katana is the landowner of the Black Heron, and prepares to head out to arrest him. When Hashi inquires as to Allen's whereabouts, West covers for him, placing her in a particularly tight spot.</p><p>West knows that Allen is already at the Black Heron, as the Flash. West fears his long absence means that the Flash is in trouble. Hashi, though, won't head to the Black Heron, and the Flash's rescue, without Allen. West is faced with the prospect of revealing Allen's identity as the Flash to Hashi and Toshiro, in order to get them to storm the Black Heron, and save the Flash's life.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Flash learns about an assassination attempt prior to a scheduled speaking engagement at a police symposium in Central City; crooks capture Flash in ice.</em></p><p>Police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, boards a bus, traveling from Borderville to Central City. Allen is being tailed by Tips, a criminal in the employ of the Frog. Onboard the coach, Allen \"accidentally\" reveals his Flash costume, when his suitcase briefly pops open. In Central City, Tips reports to the Frog that the man he has been following all week might be Allen, or he might just be an unemployed actor. Allen gets into his car, and comes face-to-face with himself. The crooks tail Allen to the police symposium, where the Flash will be giving a lecture. Tips follows the Flash into the symposium, while the Frog continues following Allen's car.</p><p>The Frog sends his henchmen, Li'l Moe and Slice, into a parking garage to collect Allen. The two thugs just miss getting their hands on Allen, who escapes them in the elevator. When the elevator returns to the parking garage, the crooks find a lifelike rubber mask, of Barry Allen's face, on the elevator floor. Picture News reporter, Iris West, joins the Flash at the police symposium. With whispered words, she reveals that she was the \"Barry Allen\", who picked up Allen at the bus terminal. Somehow, the Frog has learned that Barry Allen is the Flash, thus a ruse has been played out to sow doubt in the crooks' minds. An assassin, disguised as a waiter, shoots the Flash.</p><p>The second the Flash hears the explosion of the expanding gases in the gun barrel, he begins vibrating at super-speed, so that the bullet passes harmlessly through him. Tips guns down the assassin, then identifies himself as a Borderville detective. Suspicious, the Flash tails Tips. Giving himself away in the stairwell, the Flash finds himself being fired upon by Tips. The Flash tackles Tips, landing in the hotel kitchen. Tips pies the Flash, blinding him, then covers the floor in pies. The Flash skids across the kitchen floor. Tips pours scalding hot coffee on the Flash's face, then sprays him down with a hose from the sink.</p><p>Tips produces an instant-icer, and freezes the Flash solid, in a block of ice. Tips informs the Frog that he has taken care of the Flash. Tips demonstrates the instant-icer by flash-freezing a doorman. With their sole obstacle out of the way, the Frog embarks on his latest criminal enterprise. Li'l Moe, and Slice, beat down a cargo handler, and a security guard, at a local airfield, and take their places. As a shipment of rare palladium arrives, the crooks steal it, and load it into their own plane. Using his complete molecular mastery over his own body, the Flash is able to break free from his icy encasement. By vibrating at the same frequency as the instant-icer, the Flash is able to track the crooks down at the airfield.</p><p>Tips tries to freeze the Flash again, only to see the Flash turn the instant-icer against him. With the Flash vibrating into intangibility to avoid their gunfire, L'il Moe suddenly releases all of his ammo onto the ground. The Flash slips on the rolling bullets, giving the crooks the opportunity to run the Flash over, with their plane. At the last second, the Flash rolls out of the way. Leaping onto the plane, the Flash manipulates the plane's rudder, causing it to crash. After defeating the Frog, L'il Moe, and Slice, the Flash returns to the police symposium to deliver his speech.</p>",
